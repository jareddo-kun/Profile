# FEU Grade Calculator — Activation Web App

This web app allows FEU students and faculty to **activate** and **manage** their own copy of the FEU Grade Calculator Google Sheet through a simple web interface.  
It connects securely with Google Apps Script to enable spreadsheet features such as automatic formula setup, protection settings, and visual interface integration.
